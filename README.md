## Origin

I was waiting for someone to write this app but no one did so I make it happen.
There's a huge inspiration from http://letsmake.github.com/bettertogether/

## What is it?

An app to browse GitHub in a pretty way. Uses a large part of the GitHub API.

## What is not?

An official app. It's just my side project so don't blame GitHub for my mistakes
:D.

## Features

* i18n
* System Notifications
* Badge alerts
* Fast
* Minimal clutter

## Contribute

Please contribute. The app aims to have several languages so translators are
needed.
